## General info
* In this project, I take a look at the client's site viz "https://www.denksport.com/puzzel" filter section.
* Modified the filter section by applying some CSS to improve the overall User experience for desktop and mobile version respectively.
* Push the most frequent used filter to the top on the Product List Page.
* Change the positions of applied filters to their respective parent title block instead of all of them placed together using jQuery and Javasciprt.
* It will make the user experience more efficient and improve their CTR.
* It will help the user to select the most common used filter's product, Which increases the client's revenue.
